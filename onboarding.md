# Onboarding

##  Engineer Onboarding <br>

### Engineering-Based
Allow your new mate a few days to understand how does the codebase works, how does the team work. Never assume they can be work perfectly without any training.

This training is not to teach them how to code, how to use IDE, but understand the `structure of codebase(project)` can make them easier know how to build a <b>Code-Review-Qualified</b> function, to saving communication cost, and extra code work.

There are few things we can try to do with this stage: 

- Design a `micro-function` to traning your mate (2-weeks, or even more).

  In this stage, the `micro-function` should be covered few following things:

  - Design Pattern
    - Object-oriented Programming? Functional Programming?
  - Software architecture
    - Docker? Kubernetes? Pure-VM? Serverless?
    - Micro-service?
      - gRPC? HTTP?
      - API Gateway?
      - Service Mesh?
  - Unit Test Coverage


### Team Work
Understand the team work-flow, such as: 

1. When is a good moment to ask other teammates about the problem you meet, or been blocked?
2. How to schedule a meeting if you need additional help from your team?
3. How to do if you are unable to deliver your task on the time you scheduled with your team?
4. How to reschedule a task-assignment?
5. When you meet a block, who should be reported to?
6. How to do if you cannot get help from your direct reporter/manager?
